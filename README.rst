Auto Remove Torrents
======================
|Docker|

This program can help you to remove your torrents. Now you don't need to worry about your disk space - according to your strategies, the program will check each torrent if it satisfies the remove condition; If so, delete it automatically.

This program supports qBittorrent/Transmission/μTorrent. If you like, star it :star2: :)

Requirements
-------------
* Python 2.7 or Python 3

That's all. It's a simple but smart program.


Quick Start
-------------
Installation
+++++++++++++++++++
Install from pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    pip install autoremove-torrents

or

Install from GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    git clone https://github.com/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents.git
    cd autoremove-torrents
    python3 setup.py install


Write your configuration file
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In order to satisfactory your needs, you have to learn how to write a configuration file. 

You can put the configuration file anywhere on your disk. The autoremove-torrents looks for ``config.yml`` in the Shell's current working directory::

    vim ./config.yml


The grammar is quite easy, for example::

    my_task:
      client: qbittorrent
      host: http://127.0.0.1
      username: admin
      password: adminadmin
      strategies:
        my_strategy:
          categories: IPT
          remove: seeding_time > 1209600 or ratio > 1
      delete_data: true

The program will delete those torrents whose categories are ``IPT``, seeding time is above 1209600 seconds **or** ratio is greater than 1. Read the `documents`_ to learn more.

Run
++++
::

    autoremove-torrents

If you just want to see which torrents can be removed but don't want to really remove them, use ``--view`` command line argument.


Setting up scheduled tasks
-----------------------------
If you want to check whether there is any torrent can be removed every 15 minutes, the crontab can help you. Look at the example::

    crontab -e

And then, add a line at the end of the file (please confirm the path of the autoremove-torrents and your program)::

*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/autoremove-torrents --conf=/home/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/config.yml --log=/home/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/logs

The ``--conf`` indicates the path to the configuration file.
The ``--log`` argument specifies the path to store the log files (Must be existed).

**Wed, 1 May 2019**: Version 1.4.0.

* Removed torrent status restriction in ``seeding_time`` and ``ratio`` condition (#19).
    - Before this version, ``seeding_time`` and ``ratio`` condition will only remove those torrents whose status are seeding. We set this restriction to provide a method for users to avoid a torrent being removed by changing its status (e.g. pause seeding).
    - But now we have a ``status`` filter, this restriction becomes unnecessary, and its behavior may be different from users expectation.
* Supported custom remove expressions (#15).
    - Now we can write the condition that we want directly and clearly, e.g. ``remove: ratio > 1``.
    - Composite condition expressions are also supported, e.g. ``remove: (seeding_time < 86400 and ratio > 1) or (seeding_time > 86400 and ratio > 3)``. Visit Wiki to learn more.
    - The old remove conditions are still available.

**Wed, 17 Apr 2019**: Version 1.3.0.

* Fixed bug: Program gets stuck when there are a lot of torrents in qBittorrent client (`Issue #22 <https://github.com/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/issues/22>`_).
* Fixed bug: Duplicated logging in status filter.
* Log system was updated:
    - Log path can be specified (Use ``--log`` argument, e.g. ``--log=/home/jerrymakesjelly/logs``) (`Issue #23 <https://github.com/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/issues/23>`_).
    - Logs are stored in different files by day (Format: ``autoremove.%Y-%m-%d.log``).
* Changed the word ``seed`` to ``torrent`` (`Issue #25 <https://github.com/jerrymakesjelly/autoremove-torrents/issues/25>`_).
* Removed uncessary debug messages.

**Mon, 10 Jan 2019**: Version 1.2.5.
