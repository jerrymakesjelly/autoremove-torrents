ChangeLog
==========

Version 1.5.5
--------------

*Release Date: Saturday, 27 April 2024*

* Fix the compatibility issues in qBittorrent 4.5 and later. (#157) (#173) (#174) (#182) (#186) Thanks to @Siriussee!
    - See the API changes in qbittorrent/qBittorrent#17563.

Version 1.5.4
--------------

*Release Date: Sunday, 19 June 2022*

Changes
++++++++

* Remove outgoing port status info. (#101) (#135)
    - We have confirmed a bug, which is, the outgoing port status checker will fail and report 'portTested: http error 400: Bad Request' when we are using Transmission and check the outgoing port status in IPv6 network.
    - Since there are no configurations relying on this status, we remove it.

* Change ``last_activity``'s behaviour. (#93) (#98) (#109)
    - By default, it won't remove those torrents that have never been active anymore.
    - These torrents that have never been active can be removed by the following configuration:
        + ``last_activity: never`` or ``last_activity: none`` for ``last_activity`` condition.
        + ``last_activity = never`` or ``last_activity = none`` for ``remove`` expression.

Version 1.4.0
--------------

*Release Date: Wednesday, 1 May 2019*

Changes
++++++++

* Removed torrent status restriction in ``seeding_time`` and ``ratio`` condition (#19).
    - Before this version, ``seeding_time`` and ``ratio`` condition will only remove those torrents whose status are seeding. We set this restriction to provide a method for users to avoid a torrent being removed by changing its status (e.g. pause seeding).
    - But now we have a ``status`` filter, this restriction becomes unnecessary, and its behavior may be different from users expectation.

Features
+++++++++

* Supported custom remove expressions (#15).
    - Now we can write the condition that we want directly and clearly, e.g. ``remove: ratio > 1``.
    - Composite condition expressions are also supported, e.g. ``remove: (seeding_time < 86400 and ratio > 1) or (seeding_time > 86400 and ratio > 3)``. Visit Wiki to learn more.
    - The old remove conditions are still available.
