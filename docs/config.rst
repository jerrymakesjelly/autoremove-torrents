.. _config:

Configuration
=============

Before we run ``autoremove-torrents``, we need to create a ``config.yml`` to save our configurations.

.. warning::

    In order to avoid the torrents being mistakenly deleted, we highly recommend you to run ``autoremove-torrents --view`` once to preview the results after modifying the configuration file.

The script uses the YAML language as the language of the configuration file. The YAML language has a clear structure, so I think it's more friendly than the JSON and easy to learn.

Look at the example please, the task block can be divided into 3 parts.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # A task block
   my_task:          # Part 1: Task Name
     # Part 2: Login Information
     client: qbittorrent
     host: http://127.0.0.1:9091
     username: admin
     password: adminadmin
     # Part 3: Strategies Block (Remove Conditions)
     strategies:
       strategy1:    # Part I: Strategy Name
         # Part II: Filters
         categories:
           - IPT
         # Part III: Remove Condition
         ratio: 1
         seeding_time: 1209600
       strategy2:
         all_categories: true
         excluded_categories:
           - IPT
         seeding_time: 259200
       # Add more strategies here...
     # Part 4: Decide whether to remove and delete data (optional)
     delete_data: true

   # Add more tasks here...


Centainly, the configuration file can contain more than one task blocks, and a task block can contain more than one strategy blocks. Each task block represents a BT client, and each strategy block represents a kind of torrents.

Part 1: Task Name
-----------------

Just name your task.

.. note::

   No spaces are allowed before the task name.


Part 2: Login Information
-------------------------

This part is your login inforamtion.

For qBittorrent, Transmission or μTorrent
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For qBittorrent/Transmission/μTorrent, this program works with your client's WebUI.

* ``client``: Your client name. It's case-insensitive.
* ``host``: The URL of your client's WebUI, and the URL must have a scheme (http:// or https://).
* ``username``: The username of the WebUI.
* ``password``: The password of the WebUI.

For Deluge
+++++++++++

This program accesses Deluge via its RPC protocol.

* ``client``: Your client name. Here is Deluge.
* ``host``: The IP address (or domain name) and the port number of your Deluge Daemon, for example, ``127.0.0.1:58846``.
* ``username``: The username of the Deluge Daemon.
* ``password``: The password of the Deluge Daemon.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: deluge
     host: 127.0.0.1:58846
     username: localclient
     password: 357a0d23f09b9f303f58846e41986b36fef2ac88

.. note::

   1. Don't write any schemes in ``host`` field. The program uses neither HTTP protocol nor HTTPS protocol to access Deluge.
   2. The port number is the port number of the Deluge Daemon, not the WebUI. You can find it in the Connection Manager of your WebUI.
   3. When you are running the autoremove-torrents and the Deluge on different computers, please make sure that your Deluge accepts remote connections. You can modify this setting at **Preferences -> Daemon -> Allow Remote Connections**.

.. note::

   Generally, you can find the username and password in ``~/.config/deluge/auth``. Also, you can create a new user by adding a new line to the end of the file.

   For more information of the authentication, please visit https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/UserGuide/Authentication.

Part 3: Strategy Block
----------------------
This part contains strategy blocks. Each strategy block can be divided into 3 parts, too.

Part I: Strategy Name
+++++++++++++++++++++

Just name your strategy like the task name.

Part II: Filters
++++++++++++++++

The removing condtions are only available for the torrents you chosen. There are 12 filters available.

* ``all_trackers``/``all_categories``/``all_status``/``all_paths``: Choose all the trackers/categories/status/paths.
* ``categories``: Choose torrents in these categories.
* ``excluded_categories``: Don't choose torrents in these categories.
* ``trackers``: Choose torrents in these trackers.
* ``excluded_trackers``: Don't choose torrents in these trackers.
* ``status``: Choose torrents in these status. Available status is as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status
     - Remarks
   * - Downloading
     - /
   * - Uploading
     - /
   * - Checking
     - /
   * - Queued
     - /
   * - Paused
     - Transmission doesn't have this status.
   * - Stopped
     - qBittorrent doesn't have this status.
   * - Error
     - /
   * - StalledUpload
     - μTorrent doesn't have this status.
   * - StalledDownload
     - μTorrent doesn't have this status.

* ``excluded_status``: Don't choose these torrents in these status. Available status is shown in the table above.
* ``paths``: Choose torrents in these paths.
* ``excluded_paths``: Don't choose torrents in these paths.

The result of each filter is a set of torrents. 

.. note::

   When more than one of ``categories``, ``trackers``, ``status`` and ``paths`` filter are specified, the program will take the intersection of these sets, and subtracts set ``excluded_categories``, ``excluded_trackers``, ``excluded_status`` and ``excluded_paths``.


.. note::

   1. Don't write sockets in ``trackers``. The ``trackers`` field only needs hostname, for example, just fill ``tracker.site1.com`` for ``https://tracker.site1.com``.
   2. In 1.4.4 and later version, if there's only one item in ``categories``, ``trackers``, ``status`` or ``paths``, it's not necessary to use list structure. A single-line text is enough, for example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      categories: cata1
   

   .. code-block:: yaml

      status: uploading
   

   3. The ``StalledUp`` and ``StalledDown`` is the new status in version 1.4.5. In this program, ``Uploading`` inlcudes the torrents in ``StalledUpload`` status, and ``Downloading`` includes the torrents in ``StalledDownload`` status.
   4. The ``paths`` and ``excluded_paths`` is only support the Transmission client (for now), and the path need end with ``/``.

Let's see some examples. Select those torrents whose categories are Movies or Games:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         categories:
           - Movies
           - Games
         # Removing conditions are here
         # ...


Select those torrents whose hostnames of tracker are tracker.aaa.com or x.bbb.com:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         trackers:
           - tracker.aaa.com
           - x.bbb.com
         # Removing conditons are here
         # ...

Select torrents whose categories are Movies or Games, but exclude those torrents whose tracker is tracker.yyy.com:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         categories:
           - Movies
           - Games
         excluded_trackers:
           - tracker.yyy.com
         # Removing conditions are here
         # ...

Select those torrents whose categories is Movies and status is uploading and path is /volume1/tv/:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         categories:
           - Movies
         status:
           - Uploading
         paths:
           - /volume1/tv/
         # Removing conditions are here
         # ...


Part III: Remove Condition
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are 2 ways to set removing condition.

1. Use Removing Condition Keywords Directly (Recommended)
##########################################################

Use the removing condition keywords directly. There are 18 remove conditions. 

.. note::

   As long as a chosen torrent satisfies one of these conditions, it will be removed.

The first 18 conditions are here. In order to avoid torrents being mistakenly deleted, some conditions are only available for certain torrent status.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Condition
     - Unit
     - Available Status
     - Description
   * - ``ratio``
     -
     - All
     - Maximum ratio
   * - ``create_time``
     - Second
     - All
     - The maximum time elapsed since the torrent was added to the client. When a torrent reaches the limit, it will be removed (no matter what state it is).
   * - ``downloading_time``
     - Second
     - All
     - Maximum downloading time of a torrent.
   * - ``seeding_time``
     - Second
     - All
     - Maximum seeding time of a torrent.
   * - ``max_download``
     - GiB
     - All
     - Maximum downloaded size of a torrent. Torrents whose downloaded size exceed this limitation will be removed.
   * - ``max_downloadspeed``
     - KiB/s
     - Downloading
     - Maximum download speed of a torrent. Torrents that exceed the limitation will be removed.
   * - ``min_uploadspeed``
     - KiB/s
     - Downloading or Uploading
     - Minimum upload speed of a torrent. Torrents below this speed will be removed.
   * - ``max_average_downloadspeed``
     - KiB/s
     - All
     - Maximum average download speed. Just like ``max_downloadspeed``.
   * - ``min_average_uploadspeed``
     - KiB/s
     - All
     - Minimum average upload speed. Just like ``min_uploadspeed``.
   * - ``max_size``
     - GiB
     - All
     - Torrent size limitation. Remove those torrents whose size exceeds the limit.
   * - ``max_seeder``
     - 
     - All
     - Maximum number of seeders. When the seeders exceeds the limitation, the torrent will be removed.
   * - ``max_upload``
     - GiB
     - All
     - Maximum uploaded size of a torrent. Torrents whose uploaded size exceed this limitation will be removed.
   * - ``min_leecher``
     - 
     - All
     - Minimum number of leechers. When the number of leechers is less than the settings, the torrent will be removed.
   * - ``max_connected_seeder``
     -
     - Downloading or Uploading
     - Maximum number of connected seeders. Just like ``max_seeder``.
   * - ``min_connected_leecher``
     -
     - Downloading or Uploading
     - Minimum number of connected leechers. Just like ``min_leecher``.
   * - ``last_activity``
     - Second
     - All
     - The maximum time allowed since a torrent has stopped being active, that is, the maximum time without uploading or downloading. When the torrent reaches the limit, it will be removed.
   * - ``max_progress``
     - Percent (%)
     - All
     - The maximum download progress. The maximum value is 100.
   * - ``upload_ratio``
     - 
     - All
     - The maximum upload ratio. Note that the upload ratio here is different from the ratio. For each torrent, the upload ratio is ``uploaded size`` divided by its ``size``.

.. note::

   In version 1.5.4 and above, the behavior of ``last_activity`` has been changed. By default, it only considers those torrents that have ever been active, and the other torrents, which have no activity yet, won't be deleted.

   Moreover, to remove those torrents that have never been active, please use ``last_activity: Never`` or ``last_activity: None``.

Beside these condition, the other 3 remove conditions are here. The rest of the torrents will be removed if they trigger these conditions.

* ``seed_size``: Calculate the total size of the torrents you chosen. If the total size exceeds the limit, some of the torrents will be removed. The following two properties must be specificed.
  
  - ``limit``: Limit of the total size, in GiB.
  - ``action``: Determine which torrents will be removed. Can be the following values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - Value
       - Description
     * - remove-old-seeds
       - Try to remove old torrents.
     * - remove-new-seeds
       - Try to remove new torrents.
     * - remove-big-seeds
       - Try to remove large torrents.
     * - remove-small-seeds
       - Try to remove small torrents.
     * - remove-active-seeds
       - Try to remove active torrents.
     * - remove-inactive-seeds
       - Try to remove inactive torrents.
     * - remove-fast-upload-seeds
       - Try to remove torrents with fast upload speeds.
     * - remove-slow-upload-seeds
       - Try to remove torrents with slow upload speeds.

  .. note::

     Similar to ``last_activity``, the action ``remove-active-seeds`` and ``remove-inactive-seeds`` first consider those torrents that were once active. Only if these torrents are all removed but the constraints are still not met, the torrents that have never been active can be removed (but the order is not guaranteed).

* ``maximum_number``: Set the maximum number of torrents. When the number of chosen torrents is exceed the maximum number, some of the torrents will be deleted, just like the condition `seed_size`. The following two properties must be specified:
  
  - ``limit``: Maximum number limitation
  - ``action``: Determine which torrents will be removed. The values and its meanings are in the table above.

* ``free_space``: Check the free space on disk is enough or not. When the free space is not enough, some of the chosen torrents will be deleted, just like the condition `seed_size`. The following three properties should be specified:
  
  - ``min``: Minimum free space, in `GiB`. When the free space of the specified directory is less than this value, the removing strategy will be trigger.
  - ``path``: Directory that needs to be monitored
  - ``action``: Removing strategy, which determines which torrents will be removed. The values and its meanings are in the table above.

* ``remote_free_space``: Decide which torrents to be removed based on the free space too, but use the free space data reported by the bittorrent client. Its behavior is the same as the ``free_space``.

  - ``min``: Minimum free space, in `GiB`.
  - ``path``: Directory that needs to be checked by the bittorrent client.
  - ``action``: Removing strategy.

.. note::

   If your autoremove-torrents and your bittorrent client are running on different machines, you need to use ``remote_free_space`` to check the free spaces. Besides, ``free_space`` and ``remote_free_space`` are the same.

   Please note that not all of the clients support checking the specified path. Currently, only Deluge and Transmission support, and the parameter ``path`` in ``remote_free_space`` will be ignored in qBittorrent.

Here is an example. For torrents whose categories are xxx or yyy, it removes the torrents which ratio is greater than 1 or seeding time is more than 1209600 seconds:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         categories:
           - xxx
           - yyy
         ratio: 1
         seeding_time: 1209600


Here is another example. For all torrents, it removes the torrents which seeding time is greater than 259200 seconds:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         seeding_time: 259200


Here is another another example. For all torrents, when the free space in directory `/home/myserver/downloads` is less than 10GiB, the program will try to remove the big torrents:

.. code-block:: yaml    

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         free_space:
           min: 10
           path: /home/myserver/downloads
           action: remove-big-seeds

Here is the last example. For all torrents, remove those torrents whose ratio is greater than 3 first, and then if the total size of the rest of torrents is larger than 500 GiB, it will remove active torrents until the total size is less than 500 GiB:

.. code-block:: yaml

   my_task:
     client: xxx
     host: xxx
     username: xxx
     password: xxx
     strategies:
       my_strategy:
         ratio: 3
         seed_size:
           limit: 500
           action: remove-active-seeds

2. Use ``remove`` Keyword (Advanced)
#####################################

Use the ``remove`` keyword. The ``remove`` keyword is a new keyword in version 1.4.0, which supports the complex removing condition. The ``remove`` keyword is followed by an expression, which consists of the following syntax:

1. ``<Parameter> <Comparison Operator> <Value>``

   ``Parameter``: Available parameters are as follows, and they are case-insensitive. 
   
   .. note::
   
       Some properties can only be used in specific status. The torrents not in available status will not be removed.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
       
      * - Parameter
        - Unit
        - Available Status

      * - ``create_time``
        - Second
        - All
        - The elapsed time since the torrent was added to the client.
      * - ``download``
        - GiB
        - All
        - Downloaded Size
      * - ``download_speed``
        - KiB/s
        - Downloading
        - Download speed.
      * - ``downloading_time``
        - Second
        - All
        - Downloading time.
      * - ``last_activity``
        - Second
        - All
        - The elapsed time since the torrent has stopped being active (without uploading or downloading).
      * - ``leecher``
        - /
        - All
        - The number of leechers.
      * - ``progress``
        - %
        - All
        - The download progress.
      * - ``ratio``
        - /
        - All
        - Ratio
      * - ``seeder``
        - /
        - All
        - The number of seeders.
      * - ``seeding_time``
        - Second
        - All
        - Seeding time.
      * - ``size``
        - GiB
        - All
        - The torrent size.
      * - ``upload``
        - GiB
        - All
        - Uploaded Size
      * - ``upload_ratio``
        - /
        - All
        - uploaded size / size
      * - ``upload_speed``
        - KiB/s
        - Downloading or Uploading
        - Upload Speed

   ``Comparison Operator``: Available operators are as follows.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
       
      * - Comparison Operator
        - Description
      * - ``<``
        - Less Than
      * - ``>``
        - Greater Than
      * - ``=``
        - Equals

   ``Value``: Specify a numeric value. Supports integers and floats.

   This syntax selects the eligible torrents directly, and removes them directly or works with the following compound expressions. Here is an example, it removes the torrents which seeding time is greater than 259200 seconds:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      my_task:
        client: xxx
        host: xxx
        username: xxx
        password: xxx
        strategies:
          my_strategy:
            remove: seeding_time > 259200
    

2. ``<Expression 1> and <Expression 2>`` and ``<Expression 1> or <Expression 2>``

   This syntax is a compound expression.

   * ``and``: Select torrents that meet both the ``Expression 1`` and ``Expression 2`` (intersection).
   * ``or``: Select torrents that meet one or both of the ``Expression 1`` and ``Expression 2`` (Union).

   Here is an example. For all torrents, it removes those torrents which ratio is greater than 2 **and** seeding time is more than 60000 seconds:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      my_task:
        client: xxx
        host: xxx
        username: xxx
        password: xxx
        strategies:
          my_strategy:
            remove: ratio > 2 and seeding_time > 60000
      

   Here is another example. For all torrents, it removes those torrents which ratio is less than 1 **or** seeding time is more than 60000:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      my_task:
        client: xxx
        host: xxx
        username: xxx
        password: xxx
        strategies:
          my_strategy:
            remove: ratio < 1 or seeding_time > 60000
      

3. ``(<Expression>)``

   When an expression is enclosed in parentheses, it is still an expression. Using parentheses can change the priority. And you can use multiple parentheses for nesting.

   Here is an example. For all torrents, it removes those torrents which seeding time is more than 60000 seconds, **or** those torrents which ratio is greater than 3 **and** added time is more than 1400000 seconds:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      my_task:
        client: xxx
        host: xxx
        username: xxx
        password: xxx
        strategies:
          my_strategy:
            remove: seeding_time > 60000 or (ratio > 3 and create_time > 1400000)
      

Part 4: Delete data
-------------------

Determine whether to delete data at the same time. If this field isn't specificed, the default value is ``false``.

The Last Step...
----------------

Remember to check your configuration file and make sure it works as you think. Use the following command line to see the torrents that will be removed (but not really remove them).

.. code-block:: bash

   autoremove-torrents --view
